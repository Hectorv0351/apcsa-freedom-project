While still learning about GDscript I decided to work on my MVP making me think of a Simple 2D Game which seemed to be the better option time-wise and because of the level of GDscriipt I feel like I've learned, so I then started to mix learning as I went along making the MVP. During this proccess I decided to go with a game where the player has to move around and avoid the "Alerts" which after a specefic amount of time blew up. The things I found the easiest were the Player, and the Spries, because I've already did them once before as practice and just pure imagination for the sprites, but everything else was more harder than the those first things. During this period of working on the code I came to the conclusion that some code wouldn't work so I was willing to embrace Failure, because in the end I was able to see how I could've done things much better. Some online help came into play, because Godot is a place where everyone has either once made a mistake and has come up with solutions to the most common questions for game devolopers, or how I could've done it, like randomized spawn generation so I did implement into my own way making randomization either for both the X and Y axis.
