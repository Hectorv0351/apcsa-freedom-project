In my search for a tool to use for my FreedomProject I was looking into the Game Engines like Unity or the Java Game Engines like Jmonkeyengine, but during my investigation between these tools I came across another game engine which was called ["Godat"](https://godotengine.org/), which was a game engine like Unity or Jmonkeyengine. Looking at Godat I was curious if it was better or just a "random engine", so while looking into it I've come to a debate whether I should use Unity or Godat because both are great for what I'm aiming for which is a game but while looking at how people compared these like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kahPeM0scpM) I've come to see that Godat is great for developers starting out, because of the code being simple and easy to learn. Godat uses a language called GDScript which is similar to python but not quite it. Now when comparing the quality of both Unity takes the lead because of the years it has been out and improving for the last couple of years.

While deciding whether to use Unity or Godat doesn't change my mind on what I plan on making which is a game, although the specifics I haven't made up my mind on what kind of story I want to make, I feel like the tool will be a very big help in making it and I still want to make a game that I can enjoy or be proud of.
