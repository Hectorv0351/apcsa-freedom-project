When I was still learning about the GodotEngine I started on [GodotDocs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) which was a documentation of all things relating to the GodotEngine. This website was where I first started learning about the engine, and it's many functions, but also mainly learned about their use of "Scenes", and "Nodes" which apperently was where all the "Magic" occured meaning they were two of the main fundeamental blocks for making a game with the engine. What I learned from their explanation of scenes and nodes was how Nodes had many varieties and they could be used for different kinds of purposes, like sounds, buttons, text, etc. Now the scenes were made up of nodes, they had a specific way they work, first there must always be a root node, second they could be Instanced meaning they could be used called and used indivually in other scenes. 

From these concepts of the GodotEngine I've only learned to use Logical Reasoning to understand the Basic Fundamentals of the GodotEngine and how games were made up. I've also used [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGZ4RaC4O2w) to help learn the Basics and how Godot was going ot be.
