# Entry 3
##### 6/13/21

After getting used to the engine, learning the fundamentals, and messing around with nodes I then decided to get into the Coding aspect of Godot, and while the documentation was really helpful in its own way, I didn't feel like it was helping me learn how the coding worked so I moved to Youtube. In my search for coding on Godot, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdwP1Q2UlU) which really helped explain the basics of GDscript, and while watching the video and taking notes I came to a realization that the concepts and lessons I learned through the Java Course really helped me understand the code and statements because they were the same but only that they were written differently. In the end, I've learned most things from youtube especially thanks to certain people like [GDquest](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest/videos) or other small Godot creators, and I made stuff for practice either thanks them.

After a bit of Consideration I took ideas from Sprite Changes and Player movement to think about my MVP, and I've also learned some concepts through google questions people have asked in the past thanks to the Godot Community being so open and helpful.

##### Examples.
[Dialouge Box](https://gyazo.com/8e37a7ac549a47bc48bbd6eb9537c2df) which I learned through youtube because at the time I wanted to make an interaction, but in the end i decided to scrap the idea due to time.

[Triggers, Sprites Self-Movement](https://gyazo.com/d5cf3e0580e6526b955c0880e2c25066) This was  just me messing around with my own sprites.

[Player movement](https://gyazo.com/3b2db17417551c1f80c5edcda8322604)  which was the most basic one to learn, but did help learn about inputs.
