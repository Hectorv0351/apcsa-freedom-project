# APCSA Freedom Project
by Hector Vargas

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA was to choose a "tool" and make something with that tool, of course we weren't restricted to one kind of tool we could've either chosen a Java related tool, or a Non-Java idea tool which was accepted by the teacher. The purpose of this blog is to go through the steps i've went through when making this project.

## Content
For my project, I am making a 2D game with the GodotEngine. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying the GodotEngine in order to make a 2D game.

## Implications
While there seems to be no negative impacts from this project in the big picture, but I do feel like this could help me in my experience making games and thinking more like a software deveolper.
